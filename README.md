# SIMPLE DICE ROLLING SIMULATOR
Dice is an ancient game. It was played before 2000 BC.  
Project is to simulate a random value from the given Dice range.  

## Problem Statement
In this Project we will create a Dice Rolling Game, also you can select the range in which you wish to play.   
When the Program runs it will ask you, are you ready to play?    
If you were ready, you first need to set the range in which the dice has to roll, then the random generate function will print your number.   
You can play infinity number of times until you decide to quit the Game.  
Interesting lets move into it!  

## Implemented Solution
> I have implemented the Dice Rolling using a **Class** Named **Randomroll**. It will get inputs like **start_range**,**end_range**.  
> The Game begins with **Welcome to the Dice Rolling simulator** then it will ask **TO START: Enter any alphabet ; TO QUIT: Enter 'Q'**.   
> If you type **Q** it will print **Thankyou for Playing :)**.Rather if you type any thing else like **PRESS ENTER**,**ANY ALPHABETS** and **ANY NUMBER**.   
> It will proceed to next step and asks **Enter the Range:** where you have to select your range in which you wish to play the game.  
> Then it will automatically produce a random value for you.  

## Running the CODE
Code is written on a Windows,windows users can run it on Windows Terminals and **other users** can run it on their own terminals using their own commands **link reference for commands:** [COMMANDS](https://www.lemoda.net/windows/windows2unix/windows2unix.html), **Hence code might not run on other platforms**   
Codes were further executed using **python version above 2.7** better use **python3.8.3** and you can also run it in **command prompt**   

Clone into repository
```batch
git clone https://github.com/anand1431/SELFPROJECT    
```
Navigate into repository
```batch
cd SELFPROJECT
```

To run the code execute the below comment 
``` batch
python SELFPROJECT.py
```
This will check all the requirements and tell you in case the requirements are not met. In case all the requirements are met it will start running your code.

However you can also follow the following instructions to install all the requirements.
**Step 1: Check if PIP is Already Installed**
Before you **install PIP on Windows**, check if PIP is already installed.
```batch
pip help
```
If PIP responds, then PIP is installed. Otherwise, there will be an error saying the program could not be found.

PIP is automatically installed with Python 2.7.9+ and Python 3.4+.

PIP also comes with the virtualenv and pyvenv virtual environments.
**Step 2: Verify Python Installation**
As a Python utility, PIP requires an active Python installation. In newer versions of Python and Python-enabled virtual environments, PIP is already installed, and you do not need to reinstall it.

To determine whether you have Python installed:

* Open the Command Prompt window
* When the console window opens, type in:
```batch
python
```
If this command is not unrecognized, you need to install Python before you can install PIP.

If the command is recognized, Python responds with its version and a list of commands.

When Python is installed correctly, you should see:
```batch
Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jan 25 2019, 07:44:31) [MSC v.1914 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
